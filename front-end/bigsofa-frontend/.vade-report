# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Bigsofa Tanzania furniture e-commerce web application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` package via npm
- Updated `package.json` with the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the resolved dependency tree

### 2. Code Integration
**Modified: `front-end/bigsofa-frontend/src/App.jsx`**
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component alongside the existing `<Analytics />` component in the main App component
- Implementation follows the React/Vite framework pattern from the Vercel documentation

## Implementation Details

The SpeedInsights component was integrated following the same pattern as the existing Analytics component:
- Imported from `@vercel/speed-insights/react` (standard React implementation)
- Placed at the root level of the App component, after all Routes
- Positioned next to the Analytics component for consistency

This implementation ensures:
- Speed metrics will be automatically collected from all pages
- Minimal performance overhead
- Seamless integration with the existing Vercel Analytics setup

## Verification

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Production build completed successfully
- No build errors introduced
- All assets generated correctly

### Linting Status: ✅ NO NEW ERRORS
- No new linting errors introduced by this change
- Pre-existing linting issues in the codebase are unrelated to Speed Insights implementation

### Package Manager
- Used npm (as detected from existing package-lock.json)
- Lock file properly updated with new dependency

## Next Steps for Deployment

After deploying to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab → Enable)
2. Verify the `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` is accessible after deployment
3. Monitor the Speed Insights dashboard for performance metrics

## Files Modified
- `front-end/bigsofa-frontend/package.json` (+1 dependency)
- `front-end/bigsofa-frontend/package-lock.json` (dependency resolution)
- `front-end/bigsofa-frontend/src/App.jsx` (+2 lines: import and component)

## Technical Notes
- The project is a React 18 + Vite application
- Already had `@vercel/analytics` installed, making Speed Insights a natural addition
- Uses React Router v7 for routing
- All routes automatically covered by the Speed Insights tracking
